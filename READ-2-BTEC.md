# READ-2-BTEC : Investigating APIs

## API Description:
* I used LocationIQ, it offers enterprise-grade location-based solutions that are adaptable.


## API Usage: 
I used this API in the City Explorer project to get any city information such as city location,picture for the city from the map, latitude and longitude by just typing the city name in the search box.

## API Endpoints/Request URLs:
I used the EU endpoint and Search / Forward Geocoding method.

The request URL was: https://eu1.locationiq.com/v1/search.php?key=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&q=SEARCH_STRING&format=json


## Authentication Key:
The authentication key was an access token.
Access Token: pk.0a91267c4ad35e482e9587e02d355bb0
