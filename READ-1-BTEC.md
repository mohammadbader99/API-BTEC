# READ-1-BTEC : APIs and SDK

### **API types**:
There are four types of APIs:

1. Public APIs:
   * Also called open APIs that are made available for software developers (publicly), which means that you can find them shared and published for free on the internet. An organization that creates and delivers a public API might have a business plan that includes sharing its apps and data with other companies.

<br>

2. Partner APIs:
   * APIs accessible by or to strategic business partners are known as partner APIs. They are not accessible to the public and require particular authorization. Access to these APIs is restricted to partners with certain permissions and licenses. As a reason, partner APIs typically provide more strong authentication and high security.

<br>

3. Internal APIs (Also called private APIs):
   *  Only internal systems have access to private APIs, which are hidden away from external users. Internal APIs aren't created for usage outside of the organization; however, they're meant to be shared between several internal development teams to improve efficiency and reuse of services.

<br>

4. Composite APIs:
   * Composite APIs are made up of two or more APIs that work together to create a set of linked or interrelated actions. Composite APIs can be helpful in addressing complicated or closely linked API behaviors, and they can frequently surpass individual APIs in speed and performance.

### **The benefits of APIs:**

* Efficiency:
  * By providing API access, content may be generated once and then automatically published or made available across multiple channels. Your company's content is ready to be shared and redistributed so that more people may learn about your work.

<br>

* Integration:
  * APIs make it easier to embed or integrate your content across your websites or other apps. As a result, you may provide the user with a seamless and integrated user experience as well as relevant and up-to-date information. The information is given to them wherever it will be beneficial, not simply where your team has had time to update the content.

<br>

* Automation:
  * APIs enable machines to handle workloads that would otherwise need human involvement. It's as easy as having a single content change spread across multiple parts of a site (or multiple sites) at the same time. APIs, on the other hand, allow not just your team but also your agency to change workflows so that they may be completed in fewer stages and with higher efficiency.

### **The differences between API and SDK:**

- What an API is?
  * It is a set of protocols and tools for developing application software. API is a collection of clearly defined communication methods between different software components.

- What an SDK is?
  * An SDK is a set of tools for building software that often contains APIs, code, and other rules. Companies provide SDKs to developers to make it easier for them to connect with their services.

- The difference between an SDK and an API:
  * Because SDKs frequently include an API, there isn't a clear answer to how an SDK and an API differ.
  * When a developer employs an SDK to build systems and apps, those applications must interact with one another. An SDK offers an API that allows for this connection. However, while the API may be used for communication, it cannot be utilized to build a new application.
  * The true difference is that an API is only an interface for a service, but an SDK is a collection of tools, components, and code fragments designed for a specific purpose.
